# n_gram

A python library that takes in a file or a directory of files and creates a dict with all n-grams of n length as the keys 
and the number of times they appear in the given files as the values. 

Comes with functions to see all n-grams present in the given files and which ones are not present. 

Two ways of generating n-grams, one is more performant, but does not have a way of obtaining n-grams that did not occur in the data.

Works with ascii characters.
